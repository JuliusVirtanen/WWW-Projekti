      Here, we make it possible to enjoy reading Superior Stickmen and The Agency while both series' are in development, as well to read the older episodes from the series Superior Stickmen is a comic series created by
      a single hobbyist artist, which is associated as being an agent/superhero parody, while it's rip-off from the same creator is more realistic version. Superior Stickmen doesn't tackle any real world problems, since real world problems are boring
      and dumb<br>
      <br>
      The Agency is a spin-off title of Superior Stickmen with more realistic tone, similar to mostly unknown and unpublished series known as Codename: Gecko.<br> The Agency actually was inspired by the Codename: Gecko comics, which were inspired by Superior
      Stickmen, and the whole confusing history is available to be read<br>From here:
