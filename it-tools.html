      Our company's most used IT-tools are GitHub and Google. GitHub because it provides an easy way to follow the project and overall it's the best available solution. Google Search makes life a fair bit easier as it provides you almost anything you want to
      know.<br>
      <br>
      Our webpages are very secure for the fact, that we keep backups, if they go down. If the websites go down, we can easily bring them back by uploading the backup files.
      Our staff also has personally taken care of their own information security by installing good antivirus programs and using firewalls. They also have put effort in other types of information security, to make sure their computers are secure against any threats from the world-wide web.
      This in turn makes the internet pages more secure, so that no sketchy people who are unaffiliated with us could get to mess with the websites.
